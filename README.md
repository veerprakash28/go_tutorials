## üìö About

Go (or Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity, speed, and efficiency. It is excellent for building scalable and high-performance applications such as web servers, CLI tools, and network services.

This repository provides a collection of well-organized tutorials and example code to help you:

- Understand Go syntax and features
- Write idiomatic Go code
- Build small to mid-sized applications
- Prepare for real-world development

## üõ†Ô∏è Run

You can run the Go tutorial code in two ways:

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Using `go run`

```bash
go run cmd/tutorial_1/main.go
```

Directly executes the code without building a binary

### ‚öôÔ∏è Using `go build`

```bash
go build cmd/tutorial_1/main.go
./main
```

Compiles the code into a binary and then runs it.
